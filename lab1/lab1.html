<h1>My First Page</h1>

    Hello and welcome to my personalized webpage. My name is Bart Michalak and I am currently a student in the CSB (Computer Science and Business) program at Lehigh University. I come from East Rutherford, New Jersey, and am very happy to be attending Lehigh University. I have a multitude of hobbies including sports, cars, television and technology among many others. From CSE15, or Introduction to Computer Science, I hope to learn the foundations of computer science. Particularly the languages it is comprised of but also the elements at its core that functions it.
