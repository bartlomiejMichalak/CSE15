<p>   
 Hello and welcome to my personalized webpage. My name is Bart Michalak and I am currently a student in the CSB (Computer Science and Business) program at Lehigh University. I come from East Rutherford, New Jersey, and am very happy to be attending Lehigh University. I have a multitude of hobbies including sports, cars, television and technology among many others. From CSE15, or Introduction to Computer Science, I hope to learn the foundations of computer science. Particularly the languages it is comprised of but also the elements at its core that functions it.
</p>

<p> For all those members of my family that have been wondering how I am I want you all to know I'm doing wonderful! Lehigh University is a terrific place and I really feel quite at home. The classes are challenging for sure but they are extremely interesting and thought provoking. I realize I have a long road ahead of me but I'm going to make it the best four years of my life. Thanks for all the support over the last four years and for helping me get to where I am today.
